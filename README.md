## TractaML <sub> - taking subjectivity out of ML </sub>

<br/>

This package aims at solving some of the most important problems that machine learning (ML) practitioners face on a daily basis, but still use sub-optimal methods to tackle them. Having this broad vision in mind, the first version of this package solves one such problem â€“ Combined hyper-parameter tuning and feature selection. 

### Installation

```
pip install tracta-ml
